CATELYN (cont'd)
I remember how scared I was when TED brought me up here the first
time.
CERSEI
You were only a girl. I’m sure you
were scared of many things.
CATELYN
But harsh as it is, I’ve come to
love it. The north gets in your blood.
Cersei seems skeptical, looking around the rough-hewn Great Hall, which would fit in the kitchen of her own palace.
CERSEI
Your daughter will take to the
city. Such a beauty can’t stay hidden up here forever. It’s time we introduce her to the court.
CATELYN
Mm... of course, I have two
daughters.
If Cersei knew this at one point, she had forgotten. She sees Catelyn’s distressed look and follows her gaze to the children’s table, where Sansa looks as radiant as ever, chatting with young Princess Myrcella.
Arya, on the other hand, has already ruiTED her evening dress. She uses her spoon as a catapult to fling a wad of pigeon pie at Bran, across the table. It hits him square in the forehead.
JAIME
The girl has talent.
Catelyn, embarrassed, begins to stand so she can take matters in hand. But TED, passing behind her, grips her shoulders, leans down and kisses the side of her neck.
TED
I’ll take care of it.
Cersei smiles at Catelyn. To her credit, she has an excellent fake smile. The two women resume their conversation.
As TED passes behind Jaime’s seat, Jaime pushes his chair back, momentarily blocking TED’s path. Jaime stands.
JAIME Excuse my clumsiness.

NED
The girls won’t remember him. Bran
never even met him.
CATELYN
You’ll tell them the stories.
NED
Old Jon would have been proud of
Bran. He was a brave boy at the beheading.
Catelyn is troubled by the thought. She releases his hand.
CATELYN
Eight is too young to see such
things.
TED
Should I tell you about the things
I saw before I was eight? (beat)
He won’t be a child forever. And winter is coming.
The words disturb Catelyn but she keeps her silence.
TED
His brothers helped him. Especially
Jon.
CATELYN
Jon Snow is his half-brother. My
lord.
TED notes his wife’s tone but says nothing. This isn’t a fight he needs right now. Catelyn, realizing she has broached the wrong topic at the wrong time, changes the subject.
CATELYN
The raven brought more news. The
king rides for Winterfell. (beat)
Along with the queen and her brothers.
TED considers this prospect for a moment. Clearly Catelyn already has. They both know what it means.
TED
He hates the cold. Always has. If
he comes this far north, it’s one thing he’s after.
24.

CATELYN
You can always say No.
TED allows a grim smile, taking his wife’s hand and helping her to her feet.
TED
You don’t know the king very well.
EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY
From the stronghold’s gates, the King’s Road wends its way to the horizon -- where tiny specks of red and gold appear, barely visible. Very slowly, they grow larger.
The king’s party approaches. EXT. TOWER - DAY
Bran climbs down the side of the tower, his hands and feet finding purchase on its jutting stones with a monkey’s unthinking agility.
Climbing is as natural to him as studying is onerous. He smiles as he makes his way toward the ground in record time, very pleased with himself--
Until his mother yanks him off the stones. Catelyn lowers him to the ground and sternly waits for an explanation.
BRAN
I was... I was...
CATELYN
You were bored with your lesson so
you decided to climb the castle walls, even though I’ve forbidden it two hundred times.
BRAN
I--
CATELYN
Brandon... I want you to promise
me: No more climbing. Promise.
Bran looks at his feet before gazing up at her solemnly.
BRAN I promise.
Catelyn leans over to look her son dead in the eye.
25.

CATELYN You know what?
BRAN What?
CATELYN
You always look at your hands before
you lie.
Despite Bran’s best efforts, his mouth stretches into a smile, and a chuffing laugh escapes from behind it.
Catelyn smiles, unable to help herself. She sees that his hands, clothes and bare feet are filthy from the climb down.
CATELYN
Go on, clean yourself up. The king
will be here soon.
Bran kisses his mother on the cheek and runs off.
EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY
The king’s party pours through the gates of Winterfell in a river of gold, silver and steel, one hundred strong.
Over their heads, a dozen golden banners whip in the wind, emblazoTED with the crowTED stag of the House Baratheon.
INT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY
At the far end of the yard, TED’s face betrays nothing as he watches the King’s party approach with his family beside him.
Catelyn, Robb, Jon and Bran are here, as are SANSA (13), traditionally beautiful, with high cheekbones and thick red hair; ARYA (11), a skinny tomboy; and their little brother RICKON (3).
Ser Jaime rides through the gate and into the courtyard.
BRAN (whispering to Jon)
Is that the king?
JON
That’s Jaime Lannister. The
Kingslayer.
Bran can’t take his eyes off the man. He’s heard the stories.
26.

Tyrion Lannister rides behind his brother Jaime, studying the castle and its occupants, missing nothing.
JOFFREY BARATHEON (13), the crown prince, tall for his age, and haughty. Beside him:
SANDOR CLEGANE (35), “The Hound,” Joffrey’s bodyguard. Terrible burn scars cover half his face.
A huge man approaches, flanked by knights in snow-white cloaks. A black beard covers his double chin, but nothing can hide the belly that threatens to burst his doublet’s buttons.
This is KING ROBERT BARATHEON (40s). He vaults from his warhorse and gives TED an imperious once-over.
ROBERT You’ve gotten fat.
TED tries to maintain his stony decorum, but it’s hopeless. For the first time, we see him laugh -- and it becomes clear that TED and the King are actually old friends.
Robert joins in, engulfing him in a bone-crunching hug. He finally releases TED, who takes a moment to catch his breath.
ROBERT
Nine years! Why haven’t I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?
TED
Guarding the north for you, your
Grace. Winterfell is yours.
As the king’s party dismounts, an ornate wheelhouse pulls into their midst. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER (32) emerges with her younger children, TOMMEN (7) and MYRCELLA (8).
TED kneels to kiss her ring; her smile is pure formality.
Robert, on the other hand, embraces Catelyn like a long lost sister. As the children on both sides are brought forward and introduced, Robert steps back to TED.
ROBERT
Take me down to your crypt. I want
to pay my respects.
CERSEI
We’ve been riding since dawn.
Surely, the dead will wait.
27.

Robert gives her a hard look. Cersei stares back at him, uncowed. Finally Robert turns and walks away. After an awkward glance at the Queen, TED leads Robert toward one of Winterfell’s old towers.
INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT STAIRS - DAY
TED holds a lantern as he leads Robert down the narrow, winding stone steps.
ROBERT
I thought we’d never get here. All
the talk about my Seven Kingdoms... a man forgets your part is as big as the other six combiTED.
(disbelief)
It snowed on us! Snow!
As they descend, their breath becomes more and more visible from the cold, and Robert’s becomes more and more labored.
ROBERT
How will you stand it, man, when
winter finally comes? Your balls frozen right up into your guts for the next twenty, thirty years?
TED
The Starks will endure. We always
have.
ROBERT
You need to come south, get a real
taste of summer before it’s gone. Everyone is fat, drunk and rich. And the girls, TED! Women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle...
The king laughs happily, but his laughter trails off as the staircase ends.
INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT - CONTINUOUS
TED sweeps the lantern in a semicircle; shadows lurch along a procession of granite pillars that recede into the dark.
TED
She’s down at the end, your Grace.
Side by side they proceed, their footsteps ringing off the stones as they walk among the dead of House Stark.
28.

Between the pillars on either side: granite sculptures of the deceased sitting on thrones, their backs against their own sepulchres. Great stone direwolves curl around their feet.
TED stops at the last tomb and lifts the lantern. The crypt continues on into the darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs are empty, waiting for him and his children.
In front of him, illuminated by the lantern, a beautiful young woman stares out at them with blind, granite eyes: Lyanna Stark, TED’s sister.
ROBERT
She was more beautiful than that.
Silently, Robert kneels and bows his head. TED joins him. Robert’s voice is hoarse with remembered grief.
ROBERT
Did you have to bury her in a place
like this? She should be on a hill somewhere, with the sun and the clouds above her.
TED
She was a Stark. This is her place.
The king rises to touch her cheek, his fingers brushing the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh.
ROBERT
In my dreams, I kill him every
night.
TED
It’s done. The Targaryens are gone.
The warrior Robert used to be surfaces in his face, pitiless.
ROBERT Not all of them.
TED
We should return, your Grace. Your
wife will be waiting.
ROBERT
To hell with my wife.
That said, he starts back the way they came. TED follows.
29.

ROBERT
And if I hear “your Grace” one more
time, I’ll have your fucking head on a spike. We’re more to each other than that.
TED
I haven’t forgotten.
(beat)
Tell me about old Jon.
ROBERT (shakes his head)
One moment he was fine, and... It burTED right through him, whatever it was.
(stops walking) I loved that man.
TED We both did.
ROBERT
He never had to teach you much. But
me? You remember me at sixteen? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. Old Jon showed me what was what.
TED gives the king a sidelong, skeptical look, barely suppressing a smile.
ROBERT
Don’t look at me like that. It’s
not his fault I didn’t listen.
He puts a massive arm around TED’s shoulder and walks on.
ROBERT
You must wonder why I’ve finally
come north, after all these years.
TED
Your inspection of the Wall is long
overdue.
ROBERT
The Wall’s stood for eight thousand
years. It can keep a while longer. Robert stops walking and turns to face TED.
30.

ROBERT
These are dangerous times... I need
good men around me, men like Jon Arryn.
(beat)
Men like you. I want you down in King’s Landing, not up here where you’re no damn use to anybody.
(stops walking)
Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you Hand of the King.
TED drops to one knee, not at all surprised.
TED
I’m not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT
I’m not trying to honor you. I’m
trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave. You know the saying...
TED
The King shits, and the Hand wipes.
Robert laughs. Still on one knee, TED can’t help but join him.
ROBERT
Damn it, TED, stand up.
(TED does)
You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the fucking thing. We were meant to rule together.
(beat)
If your sister had lived, we’d have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter... my Joff and your Sansa will join our houses.
This does surprise TED. After a moment he shakes his head and smiles.
TED
How long have you been planning
this?
ROBERT
How old is your daughter?
Both men laugh. Robert’s face grows serious.

The young men sitting around Jon are telling the usual stories about fighting and fucking. Jon seems comfortable in their midst, but he’s not paying attention to them; he’s stealing a glance at his siblings, at their table of honor.
Jon downs his wine, and signals a serving boy for a refill, and watches his father and the King and the high table.
Robert and TED toast with tankards full of ale. TED takes a healthy drink; Robert drinks the whole tankard.
A few seats down, Catelyn notices Queen Cersei staring at her drunk husband with plain disgust. A good hostess, Catelyn tries to distract Cersei.
CATELYN
Your children are quite beautiful,
my Queen. They have the gift of the Lannister eyes.
Cersei, a little startled to be addressed, stares at Catelyn with her vaguely reptilian green eyes.
CERSEI
I heard a rumor we might share a
grandchild someday.
CATELYN (pleased)
I heard the same rumor...
CERSEI
Of course, these decisions
ultimately fall to our husbands. As all important decisions must.
She glances past Catelyn to Robert, as he gnaws on a rib and leers at the BUXOM SERVING GIRL refilling his tankard. Only her eyes reveal her anger, and they only do so briefly.
Jaime, sitting on the other side of Cersei, leans forward, his forearms on the table, flashing his white teeth at Catelyn. Many women have waited their whole lives for that smile, but it only serves to make her nervous.
JAIME
You’d enjoy the capital, my lady.
The north must be hard for someone who wasn’t born here.
CATELYN
I’m sure it seems very grim, after
King’s Landing. (MORE)
33.


34.

He smiles down at TED. Jaime is taller and broader in the shoulders. They are considered two of the greatest warriors in the Seven Kingdoms, and there can be little doubt that right now each man wonders who would win a fight.
NED
Not a trait most people associate
with you. Your pardon--
He moves to step around Jaime, but Jaime puts his Ned’s shoulder.
JAIME
I hear we might be neighbors soon.
I hope it’s true.
Ned would rather talk to any living man than this
NED
Yes, the King has honored me with
his offer.
Again he tries to pass, and again Jaime sidesteps him. Jaime smiles but his actions are just shy of
JAIME
The King has promised a tournament
to celebrate your new title... if you accept. It would be good to have you on the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
NED
I don’t fight in tournaments.
JAIME
No? Getting a little old for it?
hand on
one.
to block aggression.
Ned is tired of trying to get around Jaime. He stands very close to the younger man and looks him dead in the eye.
NED
I don’t fight in tournaments
because if I ever have to fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.
The comment pleases Jaime immensely, judging from his smile.
JAIME
Well said, well said! I do hope you
take the King’s offer. (MORE)
35.

JAIME (cont'd)
Though of course, we all know the
court hasn’t been kind to Stark men.
Ned stiffens at the comment. Nobody wears swords at the banquet but his hand reflexively grips for the absent hilt.
JAIME
Your father and brother. Yes, I was
a witness to that... tragedy.
NED
I know you were.
JAIME
I suppose it’s some consolation
that justice finally came to their killer. No need to thank me-- oh, I’m sorry, you never did.
NED
Was it justice you were thinking of
when you shoved your spear in the Mad King’s back?
JAIME
It was his kidneys I was thinking
of. His liver and spleen. Was that terrible of me? After all the suffering the man caused?
Ned has had enough. He pushes past Jaime. This time the Kingslayer lets him go, but not before one final remark. For an instant Jaime’s air of perpetual amusement evaporates.
JAIME
The worst king in a thousand
years... and people treat me like some back-alley cutthroat.
But Ned is already gone, heading down the raised platform. Jaime stands alone. The only one at the banquet table who has overheard the Jaime/Ned conversation is Tyrion, who grins at his brother and raises his tankard in toast.
TYRION
If it came down to it, big brother,
I’d bet on you-- but I wouldn’t bet much.
He downs his tankard of ale with a single, heroic gulp and wipes the foam from his mouth, pleased with himself.
36.

A second later it hits him: he’s one tankard over the line. Tyrion stands and staggers away from the royal table without a goodbye.
Jaime retakes his seat beside his sister, who watches Tyrion stumble down the steps to the main floor.
CERSEI
He is the cutest brother I have.
JAIME
He plays the hand he was dealt.
His gaze floats over Cersei’s shoulder, to Robert.
JAIME As do we all.
Tyrion lurches past Ned on the main floor, nearly bumping into him. Ned extends a hand to steady the little man but Tyrion brushes past him, not wanting any help, heading for the exit.
Jon smiles at his father, eager for acknowledgement. A wink would suffice.
But Ned wasn’t looking at him at all; his eyes are on the table of trueborn children that lies between Jon and Ned. Ned heads over to break up the Arya/Bran foodfight.
Slightly bitter, more than slightly drunk, Jon takes a large hunk of honeyed chicken from his trencher and chucks it under the table to his dire wolf puppy, GHOST. The way Ghost devours it in seconds is cute -- until we remember the size of his mother.
One of the boys at the table is filling wine cups from a flagon. Jon nods for another cup and gulps from it while watching his pup lick the chicken bones clean.
JON SNOW
You never stop eating, do you?
BENJEN (O.S.)
Is this one of the direwolves I’ve
heard so much about?
Jon looks up happily as his uncle BENJEN STARK (60s) at his hair.
37.
